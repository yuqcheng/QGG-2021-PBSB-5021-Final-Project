### Introduction

Recently, a large-scale human genomics resource Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (gEUVADIS) is published. This research includes samples from 4 different European populations (5 populations total). Each of these individuals was part of the 1000 Genomes project and their genomes were sequenced and analyzed to identify SNP genotypes.

Here, we are provided parts of the gEUVADIS resources, which is 50,000 of the SNP genotypes for 344 samples from the CEU (Utah residents with European ancestry), FIN (Finns), GBR (British) and, TSI (Toscani) population. Along with the detailed gene and SNP annotation information, we perform a thorough Genome-Wide Association Analysis (GWAS) to these data.
